  "text pasusa 1 dewalt": "DeWalt was founded in 1924 by Raymond E. DeWalt in Leola, Pennsylvania, known as the inventor of the radial arm saw. His invention had a major impact on the development of electric woodworking tools.\nThe business expanded rapidly, and the company was reorganized and re-registered in 1947 as DeWalt Inc. In 1949, it was acquired by American Machine & Foundry Co, which later sold it to Black & Decker in 1960.\nIn 1989, Black & Decker sold the part of the business responsible for manufacturing radial saws to two company executives, while retaining a focus on other types of professional-grade tools.\nIn 1992, Black & Decker launched a rebranding initiative, introducing its professional and high-performance tools under the name DeWalt tools. This move significantly influenced the market by creating a strong brand focused on tools for professional use.\nIn 1994, DeWalt acquired the German manufacturer ELU and integrated its technology into its product lineup. By 2001, DeWalt was producing and selling over 200 models of professional tools and 800 accessories.\nDeWalt quickly became a favorite among commercial contractors, especially in the construction industry. In 2004, Black & Decker acquired rival tool manufacturer Porter-Cable and merged it with DeWalt in Jackson, Tennessee.\nIn 2011, DeWalt began producing hand tools for contractors, including utility knives, pliers, adjustable wrenches, measuring tools, saws, and hammers, all essential tools on a modern jobsite.\nTwo years later, they expanded into automotive tools, such as wrenches, ratchets, and sockets.\nIn December 2013, DeWalt announced that certain products would be assembled in the United States, using components sourced from Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Italy, Mexico, the UK, and the US.\nBy 2015, the company operated seven manufacturing facilities in the U.S., reinforcing DeWalt's image as an American tool brand.",
  "text pasusa 2 dewalt": "In April 2016, DeWalt introduced a rugged Android-based smartphone, specially designed for the construction workforce. The device is built to survive a two-meter drop and operate in temperatures ranging from −20°C to 60°C, making it ideal for construction sites.\nIn September 2016, the company introduced the FlexVolt hybrid battery, capable of operating at 60V (54V nominal) and 2Ah, or at 20V (18V nominal) and 6Ah, depending on the cordless tool in use.\nAround May 2017, DeWalt began integrating Bluetooth-enabled ToolConnect technology into its drills and drivers. ToolConnect allows users to monitor, track, and configure their power tools through a mobile app.\nSome models include built-in support for ToolConnect, while others can be upgraded with an add-on chip.\nIn May 2018, DeWalt launched a line of cordless lawn mowers running on 20V and 40V, quickly gaining traction in the outdoor tools market.\nIn September 2022, DeWalt introduced POWERSTACK battery technology, becoming the first tool manufacturer to use pouch-style lithium-ion battery cells, which offer increased performance and a compact form.",
  "text pasusa 3 dewalt": "DeWalt is known for a wide range of power and hand tools, designed for the construction, manufacturing, and woodworking sectors, as well as for advanced DIY users.\nTheir product lineup includes DeWalt power tools like drills, saws, grinders, and cordless equipment, in addition to high-quality DeWalt hand tools such as pliers, utility knives, and hammers.\nPreviously, Black & Decker was best known for lighter tools and household appliances, which didn’t meet the demands of professional tradespeople. In the late 1980s, Michael Hammes proposed a strategy similar to Honda’s luxury car brand approach.\nAs a result, Black & Decker used the lesser-known DeWalt name to re-enter the professional power tools market.\nAfter the 1960 acquisition, DeWalt produced various stationary electric tools. In 1992, the company introduced a new line of handheld tools under the DeWalt brand, which previously belonged to Black & Decker's “Professional” and “Kodiak” series.\nThese older lines were soon discontinued, and DeWalt emerged as the primary brand for professional-grade tools. Industry research showed that 70% of tradespeople recognized the DeWalt name as a symbol of reliability and performance.",
  "text pasusa 4 dewalt": "Since July 2021, DeWalt has been the official tool and equipment supplier for the McLaren Formula 1 team, further emphasizing the brand’s commitment to precision and high-performance standards.\nIn 2022, DeWalt also signed a sponsorship deal with the English football club AFC Bournemouth, expanding its presence beyond the tools industry into the world of professional sports.",

Certain additional tools, such as tweezers and branded leather tool bags, are sourced from carefully selected external suppliers.\nThe company was founded in 1882 as a small forge by Carl Gustav Putsch in the basement of his family home. It began with just one worker and two apprentices, focusing from the start on manufacturing pliers for carpenters and farriers. These pliers were initially made by hand, but modernization quickly followed with the introduction of power hammers. At its peak under Carl Putsch’s leadership, the company was producing as many as 7,000 pairs of pliers per week.\nKnipex officially registered its brand in 1942, and the next generation of the Putsch family continued the company’s growth. In 1954, the third generation, led by Karl Putsch, took over the business, introducing automation, innovation, and patents into the manufacturing process. Since 1996, the company has been headed by Ralf Putsch, great-grandson of the founder, who has expanded the Knipex presence to more than ten countries worldwide.

This laid the foundation for what would later become a globally recognized brand, Wera tools.\nThe company was restructured about a decade later under the leadership of Heinz Amtenbrink, Werner’s son-in-law. It was then that the production of screwdrivers began, marking the start of Wera’s own line of hand tools. Since 1951, the company has used the name Wera, a combination of Werner and Amtenbrink, establishing the brand identity that continues to this day.\nThe production of bits began in 1963. In 1968, in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute, the company developed the iconic Wera Kraftform handle, which remains a part of the Wera logo and reflects the brand’s dedication to ergonomic design in German tools.\nDuring the 1990s, Wera Tools introduced diamond-coated bits and expanded by acquiring Drehmax W. Holland and establishing a sales branch in the United Kingdom in 1993. In 1995, manufacturing was relocated to Bystřice, in the Czech Republic.\nFollowing the founder’s retirement, Wera was sold to Bitburger Holding in 2016. That same year, a 20,000 m² logistics center was opened in Wuppertal. By then, the company employed over 750 people worldwide, including more than 400 in the Czech Republic. The expansion continued in 2018 with the opening of a new branch in Třebíč.\nSince 2019, the brand has taken part in promotional events such as Montgolfiade, Kiel Week, and Balloon Cup in the Kitzbühel Alps with a hot air balloon shaped like a screwdriver, a unique approach to engaging with users.

In the 1960s, RUBI introduced the impact breaker, also invented and patented by the Boada brothers, further enhancing the performance of their manual cutting tools.\nDue to increasing demand, Miquel Escayol joined the brothers in 1969, marking the official establishment of GERMANS BOADA, S.A., the parent company behind the RUBI brand.\nDuring the 1970s, RUBI cutters continued to evolve. The company invested in exports while also developing the mechanical breaker, launching the TS model, which became a global standard for manual tile cutters.\nWith the emergence of porcelain granite in the late 1980s, RUBI developed a new line of manual cutters adapted to tougher materials and global market demands.\nThe 1990s marked a golden era for RUBI. GERMANS BOADA, S.A. expanded by opening subsidiaries in Portugal, Italy, France, and other European countries, further strengthening RUBI’s position in the tile tool industry.\nEntering the new millennium, RUBI’s growth continued steadily.

  "text pasusa 2 karcher": "Kärcher constantly integrates modern technology to improve the efficiency of its cleaning equipment.\nAutomated systems allow for precise production control, while digital tools help monitor performance and quickly identify issues.\nSmart cleaning devices that can connect to the internet enable remote operation and monitoring.\nThe use of advanced sensors and software ensures accurate analysis and predictive maintenance.\nEnergy-efficient innovations and optimized resource usage contribute to greater sustainability and productivity.\nOne of Kärcher’s early commercial successes was a salt bath furnace used for hardening and refining light metals.\nThe patent was sold to Siebert GmbH, with over 1,200 units sold by 1945.\nAccording to WIPO’s 2024 annual report, Kärcher ranked 10th globally in industrial design with 189 registrations in 2023.",
  "text pasusa 3 karcher": "Kärcher offers an extensive range of cleaning equipment for industrial and commercial use.\nTheir catalog includes pressure washers, vacuum cleaners, steam cleaners, and specialized equipment for floor and glass cleaning.\nHigh-pressure washers are Kärcher’s flagship products, using powerful water jets to remove stubborn dirt from concrete, stone, and tiled surfaces.\nTheir vacuum cleaners are designed for both household and commercial applications, capable of handling dry, wet, and specific types of waste.\nKärcher’s steam cleaners disinfect and clean various surfaces without chemicals, making them ideal for homes and healthcare facilities.\nIn addition, Kärcher offers floor cleaning machines for large industrial spaces and specialized tools for cleaning glass surfaces and facades, delivering fast and efficient maintenance solutions.",
