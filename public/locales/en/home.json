A. Chapman, a well-known manufacturer of woodworking tools from Sheffield.\n\nThis acquisition helped Stanley expand into the UK market and solidify its global presence.\n\nIn March 2010, Stanley Works merged with Black & Decker to form the global corporation Stanley Black & Decker.\n\nToday, Stanley Hand Tools continues to evolve as a key brand within this group, staying true to its roots while meeting the needs of modern tool users.",

Over the years, additional key product lines, including hex keys and blades, were introduced.\n\nIn 1966, Wiha acquired a facility in Mönschweiler/Black Forest, where today they manufacture blades and hex keys.

  "text pasusa 1 wera": "In 1936, entrepreneur Hermann Werner founded Hermann Werner GmbH & Co. KG as a trading company specializing in tools. This laid the foundation for what would later become a globally recognized brand, Wera tools.\n\nThe company was restructured about a decade later under the leadership of Heinz Amtenbrink, Werner’s son-in-law. It was then that the production of screwdrivers began, marking the start of Wera’s own line of hand tools. Since 1951, the company has used the name Wera, a combination of Werner and Amtenbrink, establishing the brand identity that continues to this day.\n\nThe production of bits began in 1963. In 1968, in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute, the company developed the iconic Wera Kraftform handle, which remains a part of the Wera logo and reflects the brand’s dedication to ergonomic design in German tools.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Wera Tools introduced diamond-coated bits and expanded by acquiring Drehmax W. Holland and establishing a sales branch in the United Kingdom in 1993. In 1995, manufacturing was relocated to Bystřice, in the Czech Republic.\n\nFollowing the founder’s retirement, Wera was sold to Bitburger Holding in 2016. That same year, a 20,000 m² logistics center was opened in Wuppertal. By then, the company employed over 750 people worldwide, including more than 400 in the Czech Republic. The expansion continued in 2018 with the opening of a new branch in Třebíč.\n\nSince 2019, the brand has taken part in promotional events such as Montgolfiade, Kiel Week, and Balloon Cup in the Kitzbühel Alps with a hot air balloon shaped like a screwdriver, a unique approach to engaging with users. Wera tools have become synonymous with innovation, precision, and professional hand tools.",
  "text pasusa 2 wera": "Wera continually enhances the design and functionality of its professional tools for both manual and power tool applications. Joker combination ratchet wrenches feature a holding function that allows stable tightening and loosening of nuts. The Impaktor bit system is designed for cordless impact drivers and incorporates TriTorsion and Diamond technology for increased durability and performance.\n\nThe BiTorsion bits are built to withstand higher loads, while Rapidaptor bit holders allow for quick and secure one-handed bit changes. Hex-Plus technology prevents rounding of screws with hex heads, extending their service life. Zyklop ratchets combine multiple functions and are compatible with sockets of various sizes.\n\nAmong Wera’s standout tools are the Koloss ratchet, which doubles as a hammer without damaging the tool, and the Chiseldriver, a screwdriver that can be struck with a hammer yet still offers precise screwdriving capabilities. Kraftform Kompakt sets come with holders and a selection of bits packed in hard or soft cases for easy transport. Wera Stainless tools, made from stainless steel, help prevent corrosion caused by contact with dissimilar metals.",

Wera specializes in screwdriving tools and is known for integrating multiple functions into one tool, enhancing efficiency and reducing the need for multiple instruments. For instance, their wrenches and ratchets feature advanced functionalities tailored for demanding work environments.\n\nThe brand is best known for its screwdrivers with Kraftform handles, designed to match the contours of the hand, featuring soft and hard gripping zones.

For excellence in brand management, the company was honored with the German Brand Award from 2015 to 2017. In 2007, Wera was named a Top Innovator.

This tool would later become globally recognized as the famous RUBI tile cutter, a benchmark in the field of ceramic cutting tools.\n\nAfter winning the gold medal at the First National Invention Exhibition in Barcelona in 1953, brothers Joan and Antoni Boada focused on producing and improving this groundbreaking tool. In the 1960s, RUBI introduced the impact breaker, also invented and patented by the Boada brothers, further enhancing the performance of their manual cutting tools.\n\nDue to increasing demand, Miquel Escayol joined the brothers in 1969, marking the official establishment of GERMANS BOADA, S.A., the parent company behind the RUBI brand.\n\nDuring the 1970s, RUBI cutters continued to evolve. The company invested in exports while also developing the mechanical breaker, launching the TS model, which became a global standard for manual tile cutters.\n\nWith the emergence of porcelain granite in the late 1980s, RUBI developed a new line of manual cutters adapted to tougher materials and global market demands.\n\nThe 1990s marked a golden era for RUBI. GERMANS BOADA, S.A. expanded by opening subsidiaries in Portugal, Italy, France, and other European countries, further strengthening RUBI’s position in the tile tool industry.\n\nEntering the new millennium, RUBI’s growth continued steadily.
