  "text pasusa 1 knipex": "Knipex is a fourth-generation, family-owned and independent company based in Cronenberg, Wuppertal, located in the heart of Germany’s tool manufacturing region. Renowned for its high-quality pliers and specialized hand tools, Knipex produces all core items, including premium pliers and professional tools, exclusively in Germany. Certain additional tools, such as tweezers and branded leather tool bags, are sourced from carefully selected external suppliers.\n\nThe company was founded in 1882 as a small forge by Carl Gustav Putsch in the basement of his family home. It began with just one worker and two apprentices, focusing from the start on manufacturing pliers for carpenters and farriers. These pliers were initially made by hand, but modernization quickly followed with the introduction of power hammers. At its peak under Carl Putsch’s leadership, the company was producing as many as 7,000 pairs of pliers per week.\n\nKnipex officially registered its brand in 1942, and the next generation of the Putsch family continued the company’s growth. In 1954, the third generation, led by Karl Putsch, took over the business, introducing automation, innovation, and patents into the manufacturing process. Since 1996, the company has been headed by Ralf Putsch, great-grandson of the founder, who has expanded the Knipex presence to more than ten countries worldwide. Today, over 60% of production is exported, demonstrating the brand’s global reputation as a leading manufacturer of pliers and tools for electricians, plumbers, and professional craftsmen.",
  "text pasusa 2 knipex": "Knipex stands out as a brand that continuously pushes the boundaries in hand tool development. Their tools, especially the Cobra pliers with one-handed quick adjustment, represent a perfect blend of functionality and precision. The Cobolt cutters are another innovation, compact yet extremely powerful tools capable of cutting bolts and tough materials. Pliers wrenches combine the functionality of an adjustable wrench and standard pliers, offering users a high-precision, durable solution.\n\nThese advanced designs make Knipex tools synonymous with professional performance across all industries, especially in electrical installations, maintenance, solar system assembly, and other specialized technical fields.",
  "text pasusa 3 knipex": "The Knipex catalog features around 100 different plier models, with over 900 variations in size, handle design, and finish. The range includes side cutters, electrician’s pliers, water pump pliers, and highly specialized tools for electronics and precision work. Electrician’s tools include cable cutters, wire strippers, and crimping tools, engineered for maximum ergonomics and safety.\n\nMost models are available in insulated versions, tested to withstand electrical voltage up to 1,000 V, making them an essential choice for professionals in the electrical industry. The tool classification system uses a decimal code that provides information about the type of pliers, jaw design, and size, helping users easily identify the right model.\n\nKnipex relies entirely on in-house production, with internal processes covering all stages, from forging, drilling, and milling to grinding and laser processing, ensuring top-level quality in every product.",
  "text pasusa 4 knipex": "The Knipex Museum, located at the company’s headquarters in Wuppertal, is dedicated to the history and evolution of hand tools over time. Spread over two floors, visitors can explore tools, machines, reconstructed workstations, and everyday items that illustrate the rich tradition of German toolmaking.\n\nThe museum is open to the public once a year during the Wuppertal-24h-live event, while group tours can be arranged by appointment throughout the year.",
