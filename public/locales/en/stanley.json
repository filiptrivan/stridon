  "text pasusa 1 stanley": "The Stanley Tools brand has a long-standing tradition in the hand tool industry.\n\nThe Stanley Works was founded by Frederick Trent Stanley in 1843 in New Britain, Connecticut, originally as a manufacturer of door bolts and hardware.\n\nAnother company, The Stanley Rule and Level, was founded by his cousin, Henry Stanley, in 1857, also in New Britain.\n\nIn 1920, the two companies merged, and the hand tool division continued to operate under The Stanley Works.\n\nThis merger laid the foundation for the development of Stanley hand tools, which would later become a symbol of reliability and precision in the carpentry and construction industries.\n\nAround 1937, Stanley acquired the British company J. A. Chapman, a well-known manufacturer of woodworking tools from Sheffield.\n\nThis acquisition helped Stanley expand into the UK market and solidify its global presence.\n\nIn March 2010, Stanley Works merged with Black & Decker to form the global corporation Stanley Black & Decker.\n\nToday, Stanley Hand Tools continues to evolve as a key brand within this group, staying true to its roots while meeting the needs of modern tool users.",
